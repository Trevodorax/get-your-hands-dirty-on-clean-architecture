Summary of the great book *Get Your Hands Dirty On Clean Architecture* by Tom Hombergs chapter by chapter, with extra explanations I needed to understand it.

I do not pretend to be an expert, or to have understood everything in the book

I do believe that this summary might be useful for people trying to get into software architecture without having to read a complete book about it.
