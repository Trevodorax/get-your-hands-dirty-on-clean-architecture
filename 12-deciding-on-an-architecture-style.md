# Deciding on an architecture style

This chapter helps us choose when we want to choose the hexagonal architecture.

## The domain is king

Hexagonal architecture's biggest power is that it makes DDD easy.

It allows the domain to depend on nothing, and therefore lets us create a rich domain with all the logic in it.

If the domain isn't the main part of your project, maybe an hexagonal architecture isn't for you.

## Experience is queen

Most of devs have strong experience in the layered architecture style.

It's fine to build it, as it has almost become a habit.

If you've never used hexagonal architecture before, try it out, get some experience and you'll have a greater chance of using it later.

## It depends

You just have to adapt to the context, the type of project, etc.
