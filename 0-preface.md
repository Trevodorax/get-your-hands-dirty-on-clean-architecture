This book is there to give you control over the software you write.

It does so by showing you a way to make your software adaptable to any situation or change.

# Who should read this book?

Developers of all levels of experience, with basic understanding of web apps and OOP.

## Juniors

To learn how to create clean modular applications.

## Experienced

To compare the concepts of the book with your current methods, and integrate some of them to your toolbox.

# The example application

[BuckPal](https://github.com/thombergs/buckpal) is the app we'll be building in the whole book.

It is a money transfer app.

# A note on code examples

To make the examples less verbose and focus on what's important, Lombok annotations are there to make it more concise.

To make the examples work, you must generate code from the annotations.
